<h3>Feedback is appreciated!</h3>
<p>I'd really appreciate any feedback or suggestions you're willing to give surrounding the game. I want to improve upon it as much as possible. There's an anonymous survey <a href="https://forms.gle/GJ1UKz77JCWxiarL7">HERE</a>.</p>
<h3>Download Instructions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Download the correct zip file. If you have Windows (64-bit), the application can be used without having to install Java; just download the "java-embedded" file. If you don't know if you have Java or not, just get the Java embedded file. If you run Mac OS or don't have Windows (64-bit) or Java, you're out of luck.

<h1>How To Play Pendula</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pendula is a one-tap game</li>
  <li>Goal: to get the final, smallest dot to end up inside the red dot, currently placed randomly.</li>
  <li>You can accomplish this by freezing the active (green) pendulum, which makes the next smallest rod active.</li>
  <li>Freeze the active rod by pressing the space bar or clicking the mouse</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scoring</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Each time you freeze a rod, you get 2 points.</li>
  <li>For every full rotation a rod completes (passes the faint blue line), you lose 1 point for that rod. You won't lose points overall after successfully completing a round.</li>
  <li>Therefore, it is to your advantage to complete the rounds quickly.</li>
  <li>However, if the smallest dot does not successfully land on the red goal, you lose. You get 0 points for the round and must start over.</li>
  <li>My high score is 165. See if you can beat it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Frequently Asked Question</h3>
<p>Why did I die?</p>
<p>The round automatically ends if all of your remaining unfrozen bars are not long enough to reach the goal, making it impossible to win. This will be a setting in the final version.</p>
<h3>Future Plans</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Big goal: publish as a well-put-together, free app on the Google Play Store (Android app store).</li>
    <li>Add things that apps have: settings, title screen, etc.</li>
    <li>Maybe migrate from Processing to Android Studio.</li>
    <li>Color scheme settings</li>
    <li>Fix the high score (it's just a bit off)</li>
    <li>Levels, maybe a level editor to speed that up. Things that can change:
      <ul>
        <li>Size of the goal</li>
        <li>Number of bars</li>
        <li>Length of bars</li>
        <li>Speed of rotation</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If you're way down here, you might be very interested. If you'd like to help, level design is quite a bit of work (not hard, but a lot). Also, some design help would be useful, I'm not super artistic, clearly. Just say something in the survey listed at the top of the page.</li>
  </ul>
